This statement by Professor Lee marked the beginning of my internship at the User Experience Lab, following my exchange semester at SNU.
<br><br>
Who am I?<br>
Name: Teresa Müller<br>
Home University: TU Dresden, Germany<br>
Major: MSc Psychology <br>
Why SNU? To pursue my fascination for East Asia as an exchange student during the spring semester of 2023 (March-June). <br>
Why UX Lab? To experience Korean working culture in my field of interest. <br>
<br><br>
As the first ever foreign intern at the lab, I wasn’t sure if I should be happy about being accepted, or interpret these words as a threat for what‘s to come?
 <br><br>
Consulting ChatGPT about it revealed that “surviving in a Korean work environment can be challenging, as it often involves long hours, strict hierarchies, and a strong emphasis on teamwork” (OpenAI, 2023).
<br><br>
But the warnings didn’t stop me, and I started my internship with an open mind and the motivation to do my best. However, without any expectations.
<br><br>
So, what was it actually like, and what did a German graduate psychology student learn about the all-Korean environment of the UX lab during her three weeks of internship in July?
<br><br>
How to survive at SNU UX Lab?
1)	Come up with an experience design concept inspired by Dissociative Identity Disorder by the next day.<br>
2)	Be prepared for escape rooms, museum visits, and hours of brainstorming with your lab members.<br>
3)	Follow Google Assistant’s orders to go home at 6 p.m. <br>
4)	Learn to use the expression 개 쩐다 (translates to "amazing") in the right context which your lab members taught you.<br>
5)	Join the lab party at the professor’s house.<br>
6)	Make sure to choose your daily lunch delivery menu in a timely manner. <br>
7)	Last but not least, be encouraged by your lab members: 
<br><br>
When I was exhausted, out of ideas, or felt discouraged, there was always someone to pick me up. Once, when I couldn’t think of a way to improve a concept, someone suddenly gave me VR glasses, and we started playing Beat Saber.
<br><br>
In those moments, I felt immensely grateful for their consideration, and I realized that the way the team members were able to anticipate my needs was a unique feature of the lab.
In this way, they managed to cheer me up and eventually contributed not only to my survival, but also my growth and success.
<br><br>
Contrary to the initial warnings and potential concerns, this is how the internship ended up exceeding my expectations. 
<br><br>
My experience with 개 쩌는 ("amazing") team members taught me that working effectively and harmoniously together is not tied to language or culture, but to people’s open-mindedness and attitude. Thanks to you, I was not only able to survive, but thrive!
